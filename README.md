# Pewlett Hackard Employee Database
Welcome to the Pewlett Hackard Employee Database project! In this repository, we’ll explore data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis related to employees who worked at Pewlett Hackard during the 1980s and 1990s.

# Background
As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, task is to work with six CSV files containing employee data. The goal is to design the necessary database tables, import the data, and answer specific questions about the employees.

# Data Modeling - ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)
This ERD illustrates the relationships between the various tables in our employee's database. Make sure to create the tables in the correct order, as follows, to avoid foreign key constraint conflicts.
ERD EmployeesERDQuickDBD-empl.png is in the EmployeeSQL folder. Here's the link:

# Data Engineering - Table Schemata
-- DATA ENGINEERING 
--Correct order to avoid any foreign key constraint conflicts:
--1.Create the titles table as this table does not have any foreign key constraints
CREATE TABLE titles (
    title_id VARCHAR(5) PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);


--2. Create the departments table, This table does not have any foreign key constraints, so it can be created after the titles table.
CREATE TABLE departments (
    dept_no VARCHAR(4) PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);


--3.Create the employees table, This table contains the primary key that is referenced by other tables, so it should be created before tables that have foreign key constraints to the employees table.
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_title_id VARCHAR(5) NOT NULL,
    birth_date DATE NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    sex CHAR(1) NOT NULL,
    hire_date DATE NOT NULL
);


--4. Create the dept_manager table, this table contains foreign key constraints referencing the employees table, so it should be created after the employees table.
CREATE TABLE dept_manager (
    dept_no VARCHAR(4),
    emp_no INT
);

--5. Create the dept_emp table, this table contains foreign key constraints referencing both the employees and departments tables, so it should be created after the employees and departments tables.
CREATE TABLE dept_emp (
    emp_no INT,
    dept_no VARCHAR(4),
    PRIMARY KEY (emp_no, dept_no),
    FOREIGN KEY (emp_no) REFERENCES employees(emp_no),
    FOREIGN KEY (dept_no) REFERENCES departments(dept_no)
);


--6. Create the salaries table, this table contains a foreign key constraint referencing the employees table, so it should be created after the employees table.
CREATE TABLE salaries (
    emp_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
    salary NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (emp_no) REFERENCES employees(emp_no)
);

Table Schemas a EmployeesSchemata.sql are in the EmployeeSQL folder. Here's the link:

## Import data from PgAdmin 4 for each CSV file from the data folder into its corresponding SQL table using
## Validate data in each table, counts, and some spot-checks 
select * from titles;
select * from departments;
select * from employees limit 5;
select * from dept_manager;
select * from dept_emp limit 5;
select * from salaries limit 5;




## DATA ANALYSIS - Queries
1.List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
SELECT employees.emp_no, employees.last_name, employees.first_name, employees.sex, salaries.salary
FROM employees
JOIN salaries ON employees.emp_no = salaries.emp_no;


2.List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
SELECT first_name, last_name, hire_date
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date BETWEEN '1986-01-01' AND '1986-12-31';


3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
SELECT dept_manager.dept_no, departments.dept_name, dept_manager.emp_no, employees.last_name, employees.first_name
FROM dept_manager
JOIN departments ON dept_manager.dept_no = departments.dept_no
JOIN employees ON dept_manager.emp_no = employees.emp_no;


4. List the department number for each employee along with that employee’s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
SELECT dept_emp.emp_no, employees.last_name, employees.first_name, departments.dept_name
FROM dept_emp
JOIN employees ON dept_emp.emp_no = employees.emp_no
JOIN departments ON dept_emp.dept_no = departments.dept_no;


5.List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
SELECT first_name, last_name, sex
FROM employees
WHERE first_name = 'Hercules' AND last_name LIKE 'B%';


6.List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
SELECT employees.emp_no, employees.last_name, employees.first_name
FROM employees
JOIN dept_emp ON employees.emp_no = dept_emp.emp_no
JOIN departments ON dept_emp.dept_no = departments.dept_no
WHERE departments.dept_name = 'Sales';


7.List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
SELECT employees.emp_no, employees.last_name, employees.first_name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
JOIN dept_emp ON employees.emp_no = dept_emp.emp_no
JOIN departments ON dept_emp.dept_no = departments.dept_no
WHERE departments.dept_name IN ('Sales', 'Development');


8.List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
SELECT last_name, COUNT(*) as frequency
FROM employees
GROUP BY last_name
ORDER BY frequency DESC;
